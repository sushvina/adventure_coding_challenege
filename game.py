For example, if you want to go left, type in \"left\".  It is important to note that your movements are traked using a grid system.  You can find your position in the x or y plane at any time by inputting \"pos x\" or \"pos y\".\nTo print a map so you can know where in the world you are, input \"map\".  It will show you a map and tell you where you are.\nAs you might assume, you are carrying stuff.  To see what you are holding you can input \"check items\".  You can also drop stuff by inputting \"drop\" or check if you can pick anything up from your environment by inputting \"search\".\nIf you want to know how many health points you have, type in \"health\"   \n \nFIGHTING:  You can also fight zombies in this game.  At any one time you can fight one or two zombies but keep in mind, your friend in fat and lazy and does not help you while you fight.  First you will be told how many zombies you are fighting.  Then you can choose to fight by typeing in \"yes\" or you can choose to get away from the fight by typeing in \"run\" and \"no\" to do niether.  To choose which zombie you wish to attack, press \"1\" for zombie one, or \"2\" for zombie two.\nIf your hp is low after fighting some zombies you can eat or drink by typing in \"eat\" or \"drink\".  Remeber that you need to have food or water for you do this... unless you are a wizard then you just need to remeber aquaerupto.  \nThat is it.  Also, sometimes you can kill a zombie into negative hp.  Don't worry about that, you are just that awesome.")
